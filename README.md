# duck-curve-analysis
### Here be dragons!
I used this project to give me experience with Go and Angular. It's still a work in progress, so there are many things that should be fixed and cleaned up. *However*, I am pleased to present this duck curve analysis tool. See the [Home page](https://duck-curve-analysis.appspot.com/) of the site for a discussion of what the duck curve is and what technologies I used. Then, click to the other pages to see the tool in action and to read the results and conclusions we can draw.
